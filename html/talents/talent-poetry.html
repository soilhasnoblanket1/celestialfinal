			<h1 class="title">The Road Not Taken</h1>
			<p class="author">By Robert Frost</p>
			<div class="section">
				<p class="lines">
					Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
					And sorry I could not travel both<br>
					And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
					And looked down one as far as I could<br>
					To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<p class="lines">
					Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
					And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
					Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
					Though as for that the passing there<br>
					Had worn them really about the same,<br>

			<div class="section">
				<p class="lines">
					Tyger Tyger, burningbright,<br>
					In the forests of the night;<br>
					What immortal hand or eye,<br>
					Could frame thy fearful symmetry?<br>

				<p class="lines">
					In what distant deeps or skies<br>
					Burnt the fire of thine eyes?<br>
					On what wings dare he aspire?<br>
					What the hand, dare seize the fire?<br>
